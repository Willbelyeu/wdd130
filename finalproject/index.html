            <p>“If you are like me, you find how our ancestors did things very interesting. As a child, I wondered how they could make arrowheads out of stone. In order to help others learn what I have I put this together to explain a few materials and how you can work them.”</p>
            <p> “The first thing that you need is a material to work with. The three I have used are glass, quartz, and obsidian. Click these links for more information about each. The only tools you should need is a point off a deer antler or a large nail, a piece of either leather or some such cut resistant pad, and a work area that can easily be cleaned.”</p>

            <h3>Context of glass in arrow-making</h3>
            <p>“Glass is often used nowadays to learn how to make arrowheads due to its availability. All you need to do is find a beer bottle, put a nail in it, plug the top with your thumb, and shake it up and down a few times. The bottom will come off and you should have enough material for two or three arrowheads.”</p>

            </div>
            <p> “Glass is easy to work because it breaks very predictably and easily. All you need to do is set your tool to the edge and press hard and a flake will come off.”</p>
            <p> “There are a few drawbacks to using glass, one such is that it is very brittle so the heads made from it damage easily. Also it isn’t a very historic material. Still, it is a good training resource as you can learn methods you will use on other stones.”</p>
