            <h3>Finding and shaping</h3>
            <p>Quartz is used almost everywhere due to its availability and diversity. It can be found in a verity of shades including rose quartz, red jasper, green aventurine, and even clear like glass. To find it often takes legwork. In most places if you go for a walk outside of developed land you will find pieces of it fairly quickly. Now this may take a while because quartz seldom forms in thin enough shapes to chip directly into arrowheads, but the fault lines in the stone are very visible so with some effort and a hammer or big rock they can be thinned.</p>

            <h3>Crafting and traits</h3>
            <p>Due to naturally breaking in concaves quartz is harder to use than glass. Still, it is also much tougher once you have made it. You may need to use your tool to strike at the edge at an angle in order to flake it. it should be easy enough to shape by applying pressure with your tool at the edge if you can find a sharp section, since it will be thinner. Where the stone edges are rounded you will be unable to break it except with a hammerstone or expanding a sharp edge.</p>
