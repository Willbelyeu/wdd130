        Homepage information

	“If you are like me, you find how our ancestors did things very interesting. As a child, I wondered how they could make arrowheads out of stone. In order to help others learn what I have I put this together to explain a few materials and how you can work them.”
	“The first thing that you need is a material to work with. The three I have used are glass, quartz, and obsidian. Click these links for more information about each. The only tools you should need is a point off a deer antler or a large nail, a piece of either leather or some such cut resistant pad, and a work area that can easily be cleaned.”

	*Picture of a glass arrowhead, *picture of a piece of glass.
	“Glass is often used nowadays to learn how to make arrowheads due to its availability. All you need to do is find a beer bottle, put a nail in it, plug the top with your thumb, and shake it up and down a few times. The bottom will come off and you should have enough material for two or three arrowheads.”
	“Glass is easy to work because it breaks very predictably and easily. All you need to do is set your tool to the edge and press hard and a flake will come off.”
	“There are a few drawbacks to using glass, one such is that it is very brittle so the heads made from it damage easily. Also it isn’t a very historic material. Still, it is a good training resource as you can learn methods you will use on other stones.”

      <h3>Quartz information</h3>
      <p>
        
	*Picture of a quartz arrowhead, *picture of a piece of quartz.
	“Quartz is used almost everywhere due to its availability and diversity. It can be found in a verity of shades including rose quartz, red jasper, green aventurine, and even clear like glass. To find it often takes legwork. In most places if you go for a walk outside of developed land you will find pieces of it fairly quickly. Now this may take a while because quartz seldom forms in thin enough shapes to chip directly into arrowheads, but the fault lines in the stone are very visible so with some effort and a hammer or big rock they can be thinned.”
	“Due to naturally breaking in concaves quartz is harder to use than glass. Still, it is also much tougher once you have made it. You may need to use your tool to strike at the edge at an angle in order to flake it. Most of shaping should be easy enough applying pressure with your tool while pressing. You will need to find the edges of where it is sharp because where the stone edges are rounded you will be unable to break it. Still, if you have a sharp section you should be able to expand it over the whole shape so long as you have gotten it thin enough.”

      </ul>
      <h3>Obsidian information</h3>
      <p>

*Picture of an obsidian arrowhead, *picture of some obsidian. 
“Obsidian is a volcanic rock, so if you live near any old lava flows it is a material that should be easy enough to find. In nature it is a black looking stone that is a little transparent. A common description of obsidian is volcanic glass, which is accurate. While it can be hard to find it in thin slabs it is reasonably easy to shape by r=breaking it with a hammer or stone. If the obsidian has flecks of a different color it may not be usable because those flecks are often a different grain than the rest, making it almost impossible to flake.”
“Obsidian is possibly easier to work than glass, and is also a little tougher and sharper. All you need to do is set your tool to the edge and press hard and a flake will come off.”
